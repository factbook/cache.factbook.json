The island was named by the first man to visit the place, Nathaniel Palmer, in 1820. Palmer was the first man to set foot on the Antarctic Peninsula and many adjacent islands. Originally a captain of a sealing ship who sailed to Antarctica in search of prolific sealing grounds, he later became a ship designer and was credited with designing the first clipper ship. He gave the island its name because of its deceptive appearance. When first seen from the ocean it looks like a typical island with no landing sites, but Palmer discovered that it actually has a narrow southeastern inlet that leads to internal harbors and possible landing sites. The island still is an active volcano, with the last eruption occurring in 1969. Because of this eruption, and one before it in 1967, the facilities there, a British scientific station, a British Customs House, and airfield and hangar, and a Norwegian whaling station, all had to be permanently abandoned.",
