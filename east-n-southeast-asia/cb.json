          "content": "<p>Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries.&nbsp; Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863, and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In 1975, after a seven-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off 20 years of civil war.</p> The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a cease-fire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore a semblance of normalcy under a constitutional monarchy and a coalition government, despite some continued factional fighting. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in 1999. A hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal tried some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity; the tribunal heard its final cases in 2018 but remains in operation to hear appeals. Local elections were held in Cambodia in 2012, with little of the violence that preceded prior elections. National elections in 2013 were disputed, with the opposition -- the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) -- boycotting the National Assembly. The political impasse ended nearly a year later when the CNRP agreed to enter parliament in exchange for commitments by the ruling Cambodian People&rsquo;s Party (CPP) to undertake reforms. The CNRP made further gains in local commune elections in 2017, accelerating sitting Prime Minister HUN SEN&rsquo;s efforts to marginalize the CNRP before national elections in 2018. HUN SEN arrested CNRP President KEM SOKHA in September 2017. The Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP a month later and banned its leaders from participating in politics for at least five years. The CNRP&rsquo;s National Assembly seats were redistributed to smaller, less influential opposition parties, while all of the CNRP&rsquo;s 5,007 seats in the commune councils throughout the country were reallocated to the CPP.

          "value": "<p>Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries.&nbsp; Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863, and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In 1975, after a seven-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off 20 years of civil war.</p> The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a cease-fire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge.
