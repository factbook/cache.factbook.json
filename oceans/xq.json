          "content": "<strong>continental shelf: </strong>The <em>continental shelf </em>(see Figure 1), a rather flat area of the sea floor adjacent to the coast that gradually slopes down from the shore to water depths of about 200 m (660 ft). Dimensions can vary: they may be narrow or nearly nonexistent in some places or extend for hundreds of miles in others. The waters along the continental shelf are usually productive in both plant and animal life, both from sunlight and nutrients from ocean upwelling and terrestrial runoff. More than one quarter of the Arctic sea floor is <em>continental shelf</em>. The Eurasian shelf is very wide extending out 1,500 km (930 mi) and is the largest <em>continental shelf</em> in the World. The following are examples of features found on the <em>continental shelf</em> of the Arctic Ocean (see Figure 2).<br />Barents Shelf<br />Beaufort Shelf<br />Davis Sill<br />Chukchi Shelf<br />East Siberian Shelf<br />Kara Shelf<br />Laptev Shelf<br />Lincoln Shelf<br><br><strong>continental slope: </strong>The <em>continental slope</em> (see Figure 1) is where the ocean bottom drops off more rapidly until it meets the deep-sea floor (abyssal plain) at about 3,200 m (10,500 ft) water depth. The deep waters of the continental slope are characterized by cold temperatures, low light conditions, and very high pressures. Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths, having been absorbed or reflected in the water above. The <em>continental slope</em> can be indented by submarine canyons, often associated with the outflow of major rivers. Another feature of the continental slope are alluvial fans or cones of sediments carried downstream to the ocean by major rivers and deposited down the slope. The following are examples of features found on the <em>continental slope</em> of the Arctic Ocean (see Figure 2).<br />Litke Trough<br />Novaya Zemlya Trough<br />Svyataya Anna Trough (Saint Anna Trough)<br />Voronin Trough<br><br><strong>abyssal plains: </strong>The <em>abyssal plains </em>(see Figure 1), at depths of over 3,000 m (10,000 ft) and covering 70% of the ocean floor, are the largest habitat on earth. Sunlight does not penetrate to the sea floor, making these deep, dark ecosystems less productive than those along the continental shelf. Despite their name, these &ldquo;plains&rdquo; are not uniformly flat; they are interrupted by features like hills, valleys, and seamounts. The following are examples of features found on the <em>abyssal plains</em> of the Arctic Ocean (see Figure 2).<br />Baffin Basin<br />Canada Basin<br />Fram/Amundsen Basin<br />Greenland Abyssal Plain<br />Iceland Basin<br />Makarov Basin<br />Molloy Deep; note - deepest point in the Arctic Ocean<br />Nansen Basin<br />Norwegian Basin<br><br><strong>mid-ocean ridge: </strong>The <em>mid-ocean ridge </em>(see Figure 1), rising up from the abyssal plain, is an underwater mountain range, over 64,000 km (40,000 mi) long, rising to an average depth of 2,400 m (8,000 ft). <em>Mid-ocean ridges</em> form at divergent plate boundaries where two tectonic plates are moving apart and new crust is created by magma pushing up from the mantle. Tracing their way around the global ocean, this system of underwater volcanoes forms the longest mountain range on Earth. Fracture Zones are linear transform faults that develop perpendicular to the line of the mid-ocean ridge which can offset the ridge line and divide it into segments. The following are examples of <em>mid-ocean ridges</em> found on the floor of the Arctic Ocean (see Figure 2).<br />Gakkel Ridge<br />Mohns Ridge<br><br><strong>seamounts: </strong><em>Seamounts</em> (see Figure 1) are submarine mountains at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft) high formed from individual volcanoes on the ocean floor. They are distinct from the plate-boundary volcanic system of the mid-ocean ridges, because <em>seamounts</em> tend to be circular or conical. A circular collapse caldera is often centered at the summit, evidence of a magma chamber within the volcano. Flat topped <em>seamounts</em> are known as <em>guyots</em>.
