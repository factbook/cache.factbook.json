The waters along the <em>continental shelf</em> are usually productive in both plant and animal life, both from sunlight and nutrients from ocean upwelling and terrestrial runoff.

The deep waters of the <em>continental slope</em> are characterized by cold temperatures, low light conditions, and very high pressures. Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths, having been absorbed or reflected in the water above. The <em>continental slope</em> can be indented by submarine canyons, often associated with the outflow of major rivers. Another feature of the <em>continental slope</em> are alluvial fans or cones of sediments carried downstream to the ocean by major rivers and deposited down the slope.

Tracing their way around the global ocean, this system of underwater volcanoes forms the longest mountain range on Earth. Fracture Zones are linear transform faults that develop perpendicular to the line of the mid-ocean ridge which can offset the ridge line and divide it into segments. The Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone displaces the mid-ocean ridge 350 km to the west separating the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from the Reykjanes Ridge. The Romanche Fracture Zone, located near the Equator, offsets the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 900 km and is considered the dividing line between the North and South Atlantic Oceans. The following are examples of <em>mid-ocean ridges</em> found on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <p>East Mediterranean Ridge (Figure 4)<br />Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Figures 2, 3)<br />Reykjanes Ridge (Figure 2)</p><br><br><strong>undersea terrain features: </strong>The Abyssal Plain is commonly interrupted by a variety of commonly named undersea terrain features including <em>seamounts</em>, <em>guyots</em>, <em>ridges</em>, and <em>plateaus</em>. <em>Seamounts</em>&nbsp;(see Figure 1) are submarine mountains at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft) high formed from individual volcanoes on the ocean floor. They are distinct from the plate-boundary volcanic system of the mid-ocean ridges, because&nbsp;<em>seamounts</em>&nbsp;tend to be circular or conical. A circular collapse caldera is often centered at the summit, evidence of a magma chamber within the volcano. Flat topped&nbsp;<em>seamounts</em>&nbsp;are known as&nbsp;<em>guyots</em>. Long chains of&nbsp;<em>seamounts</em>&nbsp;are often fed by \"hot spots\" in the deep mantle. These hot spots are associated with stationary plumes of molten rock rising from deep within the Earth's mantle. These hot spot plumes melt through the overlying tectonic plate as it moves and supplies magma to the active volcanic island at the end of the chain of volcanic islands and&nbsp;<em>seamounts</em>. An undersea <em>ridge</em> is an elongated elevation of varying complexity and size, generally having steep sides. An undersea <em>plateau</em> is a large, relatively flat elevation that is higher than the surrounding relief with one or more relatively steep sides. Although submerged, these features can reach close to sea level. The following are examples of&nbsp;<em>undersea terrain features</em>&nbsp;found on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <p>Bermuda Rise (Figure 2)<br />Cape Verde Plateau (Figure 2)<br />New England Seamounts (Figure 2)<br />Rio Grande Plateau (Figure 3)<br />Rockall Plateau (Figure 2)</p><br><br><strong>ocean trenches: </strong><em>Ocean trenches</em> (see Figure 1) are the deepest parts of the ocean floor and are created by the process of subduction. <em>Trenches</em> form along convergent boundaries where tectonic plates are moving toward each other, and one plate sinks (is subducted) under another. The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. Subduction can occur when oceanic crust collides with and sinks under (subducts) continental crust resulting in volcanic, seismic, and mountain-building processes. Subduction can also occur in the convergence of two oceanic plates where one will sink under the other and in the process create a deep <em>ocean trench</em>. Subduction processes in oceanic-oceanic plate convergence also result in the formation of volcanoes. Over millions of years, the erupted lava and volcanic debris pile up on the ocean floor until a submarine volcano rises above sea level to form a <em>volcanic island</em>. Such volcanoes are typically strung out in chains called island arcs. As the name implies, volcanic island arcs, which closely parallel the <em>trenches</em>, are generally curved. The following are examples of <em>ocean trenches</em> found on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <p>Cayman Trench (Caribbean Sea) (Figure 2)<br />Hellenic Trench (Mediterranean Sea) (Figure 4)<br />Puerto Rico Trench (Figure 2); note - deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean <br />South Sandwich Trench (South Atlantic) (Figure 3)</p><br><br><strong>atolls: </strong><em>Atolls</em> are the remains of dormant volcanic islands. In warm tropical oceans, coral colonies establish themselves on the margins of the island. Then, over time, the high elevation of the island collapses and erodes away to sea level leaving behind an outline of the island in the form of the fringing coral reef. The resulting low island is typified by the coral reef surrounding a low elevation of sand and coral above sea level with an interior shallow lagoon. Often times the remaining dry land is broken into a ring of islets. Some lagoons can be hundreds of square kilometers. It may take as long as 300,000 years for an <em>atoll</em> formation to occur. <em>Guyots </em>are submerged atoll structures, which explains why they are flat topped seamounts.

Furthermore, Gloucester was established by a colonial charter issued to profit from cod fishing, and a painted “sacred cod” carved from pine has hung in the Massachusetts state house since 1784 as a symbol of prosperity. Atlantic Cod coloring varies, ranging from light yellowish-green to red and olive, usually with darker speckles on the head, fins, tail, and body. The belly is light colored and usually spotless. Individuals can change color readily. They are top predators in the bottom ocean community, feeding on a variety of invertebrates and fish. Image courtesy of NOAA.",
