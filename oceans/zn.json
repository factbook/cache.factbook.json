Dimensions can vary: they may be narrow or nearly nonexistent in some places or extend for hundreds of miles in others. The waters along the <em>continental shelf</em> are usually productive in both plant and animal life, both from sunlight and nutrients from ocean upwelling and terrestrial runoff. The following are examples of features found on the <em>continental shelf</em> of the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <p>Arafura Shelf (Figure 5)<br />Sahul Shelf (Figure 5)<br />Sunda Shelf (Figure 5)<br />Taiwan Banks (Figure 5)<br /><br /></p><br><br><strong>continental slope: </strong>The c<em>ontinental slope</em> (see Figure 1) is where the ocean bottom drops off more rapidly until it meets the deep-sea floor (<em>abyssal plain</em>) at about 3,200 m (10,500 ft) water depth. The deep waters of the <em>continental slope</em> are characterized by cold temperatures, low light conditions, and very high pressures. Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths, having been absorbed or reflected in the water above. The <em>continental slope</em> can be indented by submarine canyons, often associated with the outflow of major rivers. Another feature of the <em>continental slope</em> are alluvial fans or cones of sediments carried downstream to the ocean by major rivers and deposited down the slope. The following are examples of features found on the <em>continental slope</em> of the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <p>Pribilof Canyon (Figure 2)<br />Zhemchug Canyon (Figure 2); note - deepest submarine canyon</p><br><br><strong>abyssal plains: </strong>The a<em>byssal plains</em> (see Figure 1), at depths of over 3,000 m (10,000 ft) and covering 70% of the ocean floor, are the largest habitat on earth. Sunlight does not penetrate to the sea floor, making these deep, dark ecosystems less productive than those along the continental shelf. Despite their name, these &ldquo;plains&rdquo; are not uniformly flat; they are interrupted by features like hills, valleys, and seamounts. The following are examples of features found on the <em>abyssal plains</em> of the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <p>Aleutian Basin (Figure 2)<br />Central Pacific Basin (Figure 2)<br />Northeast Pacific Basin (Figure 2)<br />Northwest Pacific Basin (Figure 2)<br />Philippine Basin (Figure 4)<br />Southwest Pacific Basin (Figure 4)<br />Tasman Basin (Figure 4)</p><br><br><strong>mid-ocean ridge: </strong>The <em>mid-ocean ridge </em>(see Figure 1), rising up from the <em>abyssal plain</em>, is an underwater mountain range, over 64,000 km (40,000 mi) long, rising to an average depth of 2,400 m (8,000 ft). <em>Mid-ocean ridges</em> form at divergent plate boundaries where two tectonic plates are moving apart and new crust is created by magma pushing up from the mantle. Tracing their way around the global ocean, this system of underwater volcanoes forms the longest mountain range on Earth. Fracture Zones are linear transform faults that develop perpendicular to the line of the mid-ocean ridge which can offset the ridge line and divide it into segments. The following are examples of <em>mid-ocean ridges</em> found on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <p>East Pacific Rise (Figure 3)<br />Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (Figure 3)</p><br><br><strong>seamounts: </strong><em>Seamounts</em> (see Figure 1) are submarine mountains at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft) high formed from individual volcanoes on the ocean floor. They are distinct from the plate-boundary volcanic system of the <em>mid-ocean ridges</em>, because <em>seamounts</em> tend to be circular or conical. A circular collapse caldera is often centered at the summit, evidence of a magma chamber within the volcano. Flat topped <em>seamounts</em> are known as <em>guyots</em>. Long chains of <em>seamounts</em> are often fed by \"hot spots\" in the deep mantle. These hot spots are associated with stationary plumes of molten rock rising from deep within the Earth's mantle. These hot spot plumes melt through the overlying tectonic plate as it moves and supplies magma to the active volcanic island at the end of the chain of volcanic islands and <em>seamounts</em>. The following are examples of <em>seamounts</em> found on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <p>Caroline Seamounts (Figure 5)<br />East Mariana Ridge (Figure 4)<br />Emperor Seamount Chain (Figure 2)<br />Hawaiian Ridge (Figure 2)<br />Lord Howe Seamount Chain (Figure 4)<br />Louisville Ridge (Figure 4)<br />Kapingamarangi (Ontong-Java) Rise (Figure 5); note - largest submarine plateau<br />Macclesfield Bank (Figure 5)<br />Marshall Seamounts (Figure 2)<br />Magellan Seamounts (Figure 2)<br />Mid-Pacific Seamounts (Figure 2)<br />Reed Tablemount (Figure 5)<br />Shatsky Rise (Figure 2); note - third largest submarine plateau<br />Tonga-Kermadec Ridge (Figure 4)</p><br><br><strong>ocean trenches: </strong><em>Ocean trenches</em> (see Figure 1) are the deepest parts of the ocean floor and are created by the process of subduction. <em>Trenches</em> form along convergent boundaries where tectonic plates are moving toward each other, and one plate sinks (is subducted) under another. The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. Subduction can occur when oceanic crust collides with and sinks under (subducts) continental crust resulting in volcanic, seismic, and mountain-building processes. Subduction can also occur in the convergence of two oceanic plates where one will sink under the other and in the process create a deep <em>ocean trench</em>. Subduction processes in oceanic-oceanic plate convergence also result in the formation of volcanoes. Over millions of years, the erupted lava and volcanic debris pile up on the ocean floor until a submarine volcano rises above sea level to form a <em>volcanic island</em>. Such volcanoes are typically strung out in chains called island arcs. As the name implies, volcanic island arcs, which closely parallel the <em>trenches</em>, are generally curved.

In warm tropical oceans, coral colonies establish themselves on the margins of the island. Then, over time, the high elevation of the island collapses and erodes away to sea level leaving behind an outline of the island in the form of the fringing coral reef. The resulting low island is typified by the coral reef surrounding a low elevation of sand and coral above sea level with an interior shallow lagoon. Often times the remaining dry land is broken into a ring of islets. Some lagoons can be hundreds of square kilometers. It may take as long as 300,000 years for an <em>atoll</em> formation to occur. <em>Guyots </em>are submerged atoll structures, which explains why they are flat topped seamounts.

Their eyes are green or greenish blue. Snow Crabs will eat almost anything they can catch and break open with their claws, including fish, shrimp, crabs, worms, clams, brittle stars, snails, algae, and sponges. They will also scavenge on anything dead they find. Alaska Snow Crabs are found off the coast of Alaska in the Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi Seas. Image courtesy of NOAA.",
