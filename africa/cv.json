The height also helps these islands disturb passing air masses and clouds in a distinctive pattern that can occur when a fluid passes a tall, isolated, stationary object. The pattern is called a Kármán vortex street after the scientist who first described the oscillating flow features. NASA’s Terra satellite captured this image of the swirling trails of clouds on 20 December 2020. The dry forests appear slightly darker than the rest of the islands. Photo courtesy of NASA.",

The fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is reflected in Cabo Verde&rsquo;s Crioulo language, music, and pano textiles. After gaining independence in 1975, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cabo Verde continues to sustain one of Africa's most stable democratic governments and relatively stable economies, maintaining a currency pegged first to the Portuguese escudo and then to the euro since 1998. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cabo Verde's expatriate population -- concentrated in Boston, Massachusetts and Western Europe -- is greater than its domestic one. <br /><br />Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents. Cabo Verde&rsquo;s population descends from its first permanent inhabitants in the late 15th-century -- a preponderance of West African slaves, a small share of Portuguese colonists, and even fewer Italians and Spaniards. Among the nine inhabited islands, population distribution is varied. The islands in the east are very dry and are home to the country's growing tourism industry. The more western islands receive more precipitation and support larger populations, but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged their soil fertility and vegetation. For centuries, the country&rsquo;s overall population size has fluctuated significantly, as recurring periods of famine and epidemics have caused high death tolls and emigration.&nbsp;",
