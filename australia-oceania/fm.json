The ruins were built on 92 artificial islets, stretching out 1.3 km (0.8 mi) in length and 0.6 km (0.4 mi) in width. The islets are surrounded by narrow stretches of water, resembling canals, so it is not surprising that Nan Madol is sometimes referred to as \"the Venice of Micronesia.\"\r\nBasalt boulders, some as heavy as 50 tons, were transported by rafts to Nan Madol from the other side of the island and levered into place with palm tree trunks. The boulders were dragged up log ramps before being piled one atop the other. No mortar was used to hold them together. The rock structures reach as high as 16 m on Pohnwi islet. \r\nThe roughly rectangular enclosing wall of Nan Madol Central is formed by twelve \"seawall\" islets framing the entire complex on the northeast, southeast, and southwest sides (Temwen Island forms the NW side). The foundations of these islets were all constructed of columnar basalt and large boulders, the latter particularly common in outer wall facings. The 92 major architectural units (stone- and coral-filled platforms creating artificial islets), are up to about 115 by 100 m in size, and are built above tide level. Postholes found on several islets suggest the construction of thatched-roofed wooden structures on top of the platforms, similar to those known locally. Photo courtesy of NOAA.",
      "caption": "Part of the seawall enclosing Nan Madol, a National Historic Landmark, located on Temwen Island in the present day Madolenihmw district of Pohnpei state, in the Federated States of Micronesia. The ruins were built on 92 artificial islets, stretching out 1.3 km (0.8 mi) in length and 0.6 km (0.4 mi) in width. The islets are surrounded by narrow stretches of water, resembling canals, so it is not surprising that Nan Madol is sometimes referred to as \"the Venice of Micronesia.\"\r\nBasalt boulders, some as heavy as 50 tons, were transported by rafts to Nan Madol from the other side of the island and levered into place with palm tree trunks. The boulders were dragged up log ramps before being piled one atop the other. No mortar was used to hold them together. The rock structures reach as high as 16 m on Pohnwi islet.\r\n \r\nThe roughly rectangular enclosing wall of Nan Madol Central is formed by twelve \"seawall\" islets framing the entire complex on the northeast, southeast, and southwest sides (Temwen Island forms the NW side). The foundations of these islets were all constructed of columnar basalt and large boulders, the latter particularly common in outer wall facings. The 92 major architectural units (stone- and coral-filled platforms creating artificial islets), are up to about 115 by 100 m in size, and are built above tide level.
