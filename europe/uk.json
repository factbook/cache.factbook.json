It passed to royal possession when King George III purchased the house in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte. In the 19th century, the structure was enlarged to become a palace. Queen Victoria was the first sovereign to make the palace her residence in July 1837 and in June 1838 she was the first British sovereign to leave from Buckingham Palace for a coronation. Over the years Buckingham Palace expanded further to its current 775 rooms that include 19 state rooms, 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. Buckingham Palace measures 108 m long (354 ft) across the front, 120 m deep (393 ft) (including the central quadrangle), and 24 m (78ft) high and is a focal point for the British people during national rejoicing and mourning.",

The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.",
