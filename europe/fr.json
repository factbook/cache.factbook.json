The snow-covered mountains, which form a formidable physical barrier between France to the north (left) and Spain to the south (right), are the main focus of this low-oblique, southeast-looking photograph. Scarcely interrupted by accessible passes and pierced in only two places by railroad tunnels, the Pyrenees are an ideal natural boundary between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe. The northern flank of the Pyrenees is characterized by a series of large alluvial deposits that fan out across southwestern France. The darker, roughly triangular area in southwest France is part of the forested Aquitaine Basin. The southern flank of the Pyrenees (Spain) is characterized by aridity and very rugged, mountainous conditions. Human settlement is sparse throughout the Pyrenees. However, because the region is rich in mineral waters, there are dozens of mineral water resorts, and winter sports attract visitors from southwestern France.

Located near the Louvre Museum, the Arc was built between 1806-1808 by Emperor Napoleon I to commemorate his diplomatic and military victories. Designed by Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, the proportions of the arch were directly drawn from those of the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome. Originally, the Arc served as a gateway to the Tuileries Palace, then the imperial residence, which was later destroyed. Standing 19 m (63 ft) high and 23 m (75 ft) wide, the Arc has numerous bas reliefs depicting Napoleon’s victories. Nonetheless, atop the Arc is a sculpture depicting Peace riding a triumphal chariot led by gilded Victories on both sides. The latter were added in 1828 to commemorate the restoration of the Bourbons following Napoleon's downfall.",
