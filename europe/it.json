In an effort to compensate for the tilt, medieval engineers built the upper floors with one side taller than the other side so the tower is actually curved. There have been three attempts to keep the tower from leaning further, the third attempt in 1990 being the most successful. The process involved siphoning earth from underneath the foundations, thus decreasing the lean by 44cm (17 in) to 4.1m (13.5 ft) from the perpendicular. After the project’s completion in 2001, the tower continued to straighten, without further excavation, until May 2008, when sensors showed that the motion had finally stopped.
