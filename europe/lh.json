The tradition of leaving crosses on the hill is believed to have started after the 1831 uprising at a fort on the site, when citizens erected crosses to honor the rebels whose bodies could not be found. With an estimated 100,000 crosses -- as well as statues of the Virgin Mary, tiny effigies, and rosaries -- the Hill of Crosses symbolizes the peaceful endurance of the Lithuanian people despite the threats they faced throughout history. During the Soviet occupation (1944-1990), the hill signified the public’s opposition to the ruling country and its religious suppression. Today it is a Catholic pilgrimage site, and UNESCO recognizes cross-making as part of the cultural heritage of Lithuania.",

The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top.
