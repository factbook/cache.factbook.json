Attached to the town hall in Old Town Prague, Czechia, the clock shows four different times: Babylonian Time, Old Bohemian Time, Central European Time (CET), and Star Time. Babylonian Time, which divides the time between sunrise and sunset, is the earliest form of telling time that is shown on the clock. Old Bohemian Time was used in the Middle Ages, with a day that starts from sunset rather than midnight. Central European Time is the modern format, and Star Time (or Sidereal time) is used by astronomers, with a time scale based on the Earth's rate of rotation relative to fixed stars.",

On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises Czechia, and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence when the pro-Soviet Communist party staged a coup in February 1948. In 1968, an invasion by fellow Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create \"socialism with a human face,\" ushering in a period of repression known as \"normalization.\" The peaceful \"Velvet Revolution\" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
