Inhabited since at least the 15th century B.C., the Gaza Strip area has been dominated by many different peoples and empires throughout its history; it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century. The Gaza Strip fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of the British Mandate of Palestine. Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip; Israel captured it in the Six-Day War in 1967. Under a series of agreements known as the Oslo Accords signed between 1993 and 1999, Israel transferred to the newly-created Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the Gaza Strip, as well as the West Bank.</p> <p><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">In 2000, a violent intifada or uprising began</span></span> <span class=\"TrackChangeTextDeletionMarker TrackedChange SCXW237996480 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun TrackChangeTextDeletion SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">in response to perceived Israeli provocations</span></span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">, and in 2001, negotiations to </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">determine</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\"> the permanent status of the West Bank</span></span><span class=\"TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange SCXW237996480 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">, </span></span></span><span class=\"TrackChangeTextDeletionMarker TrackedChange SCXW237996480 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun TrackChangeTextDeletion SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">East </span></span></span><span class=\"TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange SCXW237996480 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun CommentStart CommentHighlightPipeRest CommentHighlightRest SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">Jerusalem</span></span></span><span class=\"TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange SCXW237996480 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun CommentHighlightPipeRest SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">,</span></span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\"> and Gaza Strip stalled. </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">Subsequent</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\"> attempts to re-start negotiations have not resulted in progress toward </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">determining</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\"> final status </span></span><span class=\"TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange SCXW237996480 BCX8\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">and resolving </span></span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW237996480 BCX8\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"Normal (Web)\">the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
