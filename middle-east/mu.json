The pearls, originating from the Persian Gulf, were fashioned into a necklace for the president’s daughter-in-law who was the acting first lady since Van Buren was a widower. Upon leaving office, the president returned the pearls to the United States Government and they are on display in the First Ladies Exhibit in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Pearls are unique among gems as they are the only one formed entirely within a living creature-an oyster. Natural pearls occur when an irritant enters the oyster’s shell and the mollusk protects itself from the foreign body by secreting layers of nacre. The formation of a cultured pearl utilizes the same process with the exception that a shell bead is surgically implanted into the oyster to induce nacre production.

In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al Said overthrew his father and ruled as sultan for the next five decades. His extensive modernization program opened the country to the outside world.

In response, QABOOS implemented economic and political reforms such as granting Oman&rsquo;s legislative body more power and authorizing direct elections for its lower house. Additionally, the sultan increased unemployment benefits and issued a royal directive mandating a national public- and private-sector job creation plan.
