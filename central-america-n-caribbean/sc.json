Brimstone Hill Fortress is virtually a man-made outgrowth of the natural hill. St. Kitts was the first Caribbean Island permanently settled by both the English and the French who shared the island between 1627 and 1713 and battled often for control of the fort until the 1783 Treaty of Paris restored St. Kitts and Nevis and Brimstone Hill to British rule. Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park became a UNESCO site in 1999.",

Brown Pelicans feed on mid-size fish and are the only species of pelican that hunts with dramatic plunging dives, flying as high as 30 m (100 ft) before folding back their wings and plunging into the water. The skin pouch suspended from the lower half its bill holds two or three times more than the bird's stomach—about one gallon of water and fish.

A population pyramid illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.",
