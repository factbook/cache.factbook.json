Two representatives from the American, British, and French armies (the latter allies to the Americans) met at Moore House the following day to negotiate the surrender terms and on 19 October, Washington and Cornwallis signed the Articles directing the disposition of the troops, artillery, arms, and even the surrender itself.

The population is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.",
