In 1984, the Danish prime minister planted a flag on the island, prompting the Canadians to plant their flag – and leave a bottle of whiskey for the Danes. The Danes reciprocated with a flag-raising and a bottle of schnapps for the Canadians.

The population is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends. <br/><br/>For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.",
