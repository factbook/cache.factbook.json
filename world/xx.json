      "alt": "Among the views of Earth afforded crew members aboard the International Space Station (ISS), surely one of the most spectacular is of the aurora. These ever-shifting displays of colored ribbons, curtains, rays, and spots are most visible near the North (aurora borealis) and South (aurora australis) Poles as charged particles streaming from the sun (the solar wind) interact with Earth&apos;s magnetic field, resulting in collisions with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the upper atmosphere. The atoms are excited by these collisions, and typically emit photons (light) as a means of returning to their original energy state. The photons form the aurora that we see. The most commonly observed color of aurora is green, caused by photons emitted by excited oxygen atoms at wavelengths centered at 0.558 micrometers, or millionths of a meter. Visible light is reflected from healthy (green) plant leaves at approximately the same wavelength. Red auroras are generated by light emitted at a longer wavelength (0.630 micrometers), and other colors such as blue and purple are also sometimes observed. While auroras are generally only visible close to the poles, severe magnetic storms impacting Earth&apos;s magnetic field can shift them towards the equator. This striking Aurora Australis image was taken during a geomagnetic storm that was most likely caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun on 24 May 2010. The ISS was located over the Southern Indian Ocean at an altitude of 350 km (220 mi), with the observer most likely looking towards Antarctica (not visible) and the South Pole. The aurora has a sinuous ribbon shape that separates into discrete spots near the lower right corner of the image. While the dominant coloration of the aurora is green, there are faint suggestions of red photon emission as well (light fuscia tones at center left). Dense cloud cover is dimly visible below the aurora. The curvature of Earth&apos;s horizon, or limb, is clearly visible as is the faint blue line of the upper atmosphere directly above at top center. Several stars appear as bright pinpoints against the blackness of space at top right. Image courtesy of NASA.",

          "content": "<p>The surface of the Earth is approximately 70.9% water and 29.1% land. The former portion constitutes the World Ocean, the single largest feature of the planet and one that connects all places on the globe. The World Ocean is divided by the intervening continental landmasses into five major ocean basins, which are (in decreasing order of size) the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic. <em>The World Factbook</em> describes each of these five as oceans. Given the significant differences in direction and temperature of major ocean currents, as well as the effects of the major air masses above them, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are generally divided at the equator into the North and South Pacific Oceans and the North and South Atlantic Oceans, thus creating seven major water bodies -- the so-called \"Seven Seas.\"</p> <p>About 97.5% of the Earth's water is saltwater. Of the 2.5% that is fresh, about two-thirds is frozen, mostly locked up in the Antarctic ice sheets and mountain glaciers worldwide. If all the surface ice on earth fully melted, the sea level would rise about 70 m (230 ft).<br /><br />In a 100-year period, a water molecule spends 98 years in the ocean, 20 months as ice, about two weeks in lakes and rivers, and less than a week in the atmosphere. Groundwater can take 50 years to just traverse 1 km (0.6 mi).</p> <p>Earth's land portion is divided into several large, discrete landmasses called continents. Depending on the convention used, the number of continents can vary from five to seven. The most common classification recognizes seven, which are (from largest to smallest) Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Asia and Europe are sometimes lumped together into a Eurasian continent, resulting in six continents. Alternately, North and South America are sometimes grouped as simply the Americas, resulting in a continent total of six (or five, if the Eurasia designation is used).</p> <p>North America is commonly understood to include Greenland and the Caribbean islands and to extend south to the Isthmus of Panama. The Ural Mountains and the Ural River are usually considered the easternmost part of Europe, the Caspian Sea is the limit to the southeast, and the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean to the south. Portions of five countries -- Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey -- fall within both Europe and Asia, but in every instance the larger section is in Asia. These countries are considered part of both continents. Armenia and Cyprus, which lie completely in Western Asia, are geopolitically European countries.</p> <p>Asia usually incorporates all the islands of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Pacific islands are often lumped with Australia into a \"land mass\" termed Oceania or Australasia. Africa's northeast extremity is frequently delimited at the Isthmus of Suez, but for geopolitical purposes, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula is often included as part of Africa.</p> <p>Although the above groupings are the most common, different continental dispositions are recognized or taught in certain parts of the world, with some more heavily based on cultural spheres than physical geographic considerations.</p> <p>Based on the seven-continent model, and grouping islands with adjacent continents, Africa has the most countries with 54. Europe contains 49 countries and Asia 48, but these two continents share five countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey. North America consists of 23 sovereign states, Oceania has 16, and South America 12.

France considers French Polynesia an overseas country; the Kingdom of the Netherlands refers to all four of its constituent parts (Netherlands [proper], and the islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Sint Maarten) as countries; and the United Kingdom is composed of the countries of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. While not recognized as sovereign states, <em>The World Factbook</em> does include descriptive entries for the French and Dutch island \"countries.\"<br /><br /><strong>the World from space:</strong> Earth is the only planet in the solar system to have water in its three states of matter: liquid (oceans, lakes, and rivers), solid (ice), and gas (water vapor in clouds). From a distance, Earth would be the brightest of the eight planets in the solar system; this luminous effect would be because of the sunlight reflected by the planet's water.<br /><br />Earth is also the only planet in the solar system known to be active with earthquakes and volcanoes due to plate tectonics; these events form the landscape, replenish carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and erase impact craters caused by meteors.<br /><br />Earth has a slight equatorial bulge -- a difference between its equatorial and polar diameters -- because of the centrifugal force from the planet rotating on its axis. The equatorial diameter is 12,756 km, but the polar diameter is 12,714 km; this results in the Earth's circumference at the equator being 40,075 km, while the polar circumference is 40,008 km.<strong><br /><br />the physical World:</strong> the Earth is composed of three layers: the outer lithosphere (with its crust and uppermost solid mantle), the mantle (the thickest layer, with distinct upper and lower layers), and the core (with an outer liquid core and inner solid core). Researchers have discovered that a transition zone (at a depth of 410-660 km, or 255-410 mi) between the upper and lower mantle may well be hydrous (water-bearing). But this hydrous rock would neither feel wet nor drip water. At that depth, high temperatures and pressures structurally transform a mineral called olivine into another mineral, ringwoodite, which can incorporate water, but not in a liquid, solid, or gas form. The high temperatures and pressures cause: 1) water molecules to split, creating hydroxide ions (hydrogen and oxygen atoms bound together), and 2) create structural changes in ringwoodite so that it is able to contain hydroxide ions. Ringwoodite can hold 1 to 3% of its weight in hydroxide ions. Considering that the 250 km-transition zone is about 7% of the Earth's mass (the crust is only about 1%), it could include at least as much (if not several times more) water than all the Earth's oceans.<br /><br /></p>",

          "content": "<strong>The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: </strong><p>The conquests of Alexander the Great (r. 336-323 B.C.) in the fourth century B.C. fostered the spread of Greek culture to the lands bordering the eastern Mediterranean and through much of the Middle East, ushering in what is today referred to as the Hellenistic Period (323-31 B.C.). Hellenistic sightseers compiled guidebooks focused on outstanding monuments in those parts of the world, including Persia, Egypt, and Babylon. Generally, seven sites were emphasized since that number was considered magical, perfect, and complete. Not all Wonders lists from ancient times agreed, but six sites consistently appeared (the massive Walls of Babylon sometimes substituted for the Lighthouse of Alexandria). The seven described below represent the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; Seven Wonders most often cited.</p> <p>1. <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/c2f0da2e94d6bd0d6b7833317f9fa244/07fb3/EG_033_large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The Great Pyramid of Egypt</strong></a><br />The oldest of the Seven Wonders, the Great Pyramid, is the only one that remains largely intact. Commissioned by the Pharaoh Khufu (r. ca. 2589-2566 B.C.), it is the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. It served as the ruler&rsquo;s tomb and was built over a period of about 20 years, concluding around 2560 B.C. The pyramid is estimated to have been 146.5 m tall when completed and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years (until the 14<sup>th</sup> century A.D.). Most of the original limestone casing stones that formed the outer smooth surface of the pyramid are gone. Today, the pyramid&rsquo;s height is about 139 m.</p> <p>2. <strong>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon</strong><br />This is the only one of the ancient Seven Wonders for which a definitive location has never been established. No surviving Babylonian texts mention the Gardens, nor have any archeological remains been discovered in today&rsquo;s Iraq. According to tradition, the Gardens were a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of mud-brick-tiered gardens containing a variety of trees, shrubs, and vines that, when viewed from below, resembled a leafy green mountain. The Gardens are frequently attributed to the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605-562 B.C.), who may have had them built for his Median wife Queen Amytis because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland.</p> <p>3. <strong>The Temple of Artemis (Artemision) at Ephesus</strong><br />This Greek temple at Ephesus (3 km southwest of Selcuk in present-day western Turkey) was dedicated to the goddess Artemis and was completely rebuilt twice: once after a 7<sup>th</sup> century B.C. flood and then after a 356 B.C. act of arson. In its final form, it was judged to be one of the Seven Wonders and survived for 600 years. The magnificent building was composed entirely of marble, with massive dimensions reported to be 130 m by 69 m, and included 127 columns, each some 18 m tall. The Temple was damaged in a Gothic raid in A.D. 268, and Christians finally closed it in the early-to-mid 5<sup>th</sup> century. The structure was dismantled in succeeding centuries, and today almost nothing of the temple remains.</p> <p>4. <strong>The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</strong><br />Constructed in about 350 B.C., the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus was located on the site of the present-day city of Bodrum in southwestern Turkey. It was the tomb of Mausolus, a Persian ruler, and his wife -- the term \"mausoleum\" is derived from his name. The structure stood about 45 m high and took some 20 years to complete. A series of earthquakes between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries A.D. devastated the structure, which was the last of the original Seven Wonders to be destroyed.</p> <p>5. <strong>The Colossus of Rhodes</strong><br />This statue of the Greek sun god Helios, constructed to celebrate Rhodes&rsquo; successful repulse of a siege, was made of iron tie bars to which brass or bronze plates were attached to form a skin. Contemporary descriptions list its height at about 70 cubits or some 33 m &ndash; approximately the same height as the Statue of Liberty from heel to top of head (34 m) &ndash; thus making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. Completed in about 280 B.C. at the entrance to the Rhodes harbor, the monument stood for only about 54 years until it toppled in an earthquake in 226 B.C. The impressive remains lay on the ground for over 800 years before finally being sold for scrap.</p> <p>6. <strong>The Lighthouse (Pharos) of Alexandria</strong><br />Completed around 275 B.C., the lighthouse stood on Pharos Island at the entrance to the Egyptian port city of Alexandria for some 1,600 years. Three earthquakes severely damaged it between A.D. 956 and 1323, when it was deactivated. The shape of the structure appeared on a number of ancient coins: a solid square base, which made up about half of the height, supported an octagonal middle section and a cylindrical top. The height of the structure is thought to have been at least 100 m and perhaps as high as 140 m. (The tallest lighthouse in the world today is the Jeddah Light in Saudi Arabia, which stands at 133 m.) At its apex stood a mirror that reflected sunlight during the day; a fire burned at night.&nbsp;</p> <p>7. <strong>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia in Greece</strong><br />The giant seated statue of the king of the Greek gods in the sanctuary of Olympia was completed by the Greek sculptor Phidias in approximately 435 B.C. Roughly 13 m tall, it was constructed of ivory plates and gold panels on a wooden framework, and the god&rsquo;s throne was ornamented with ebony, ivory, gold, and precious stones. With the rise of Christianity, the sanctuary at Olympia fell into disuse; the details of the statue&rsquo;s final destruction are unknown.</p> <p><strong>note</strong>: The Lighthouse of Alexandria may have been the last of the Wonders to be completed (ca. 275 B.C.), and the Colossus of Rhodes was the first to be destroyed in about 226 B.C., so the Seven Wonders existed at the same time for only about 50 years in the middle of the third century B.C.</p><br><br><strong>The New Seven Wonders of the World: </strong><p>A private initiative to come up with a new list for seven of the world&rsquo;s wonders sprang up early in the new Millennium.

The site is roughly divided into an agricultural sector (with myriad terraces for raising crops) and an urban sector. The latter is composed of an upper town (with temples) and a lower town (with warehouses). Some of the religious monuments include: the Intiwatana (a carved, ritual stone that served as a type of sundial and that is referred to as &ldquo;The Hitching Post of the Sun&rdquo;); the Torreon or Temple of the Sun, a small tower that likely served as a type of observatory; and the Intimachay, a sacred cave with a masonry entrance.</p> <p>6. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/4f3550b3078560f206ed110d7d1bc78f/5f343/JO_011_large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Petra</a>, Ma&rsquo;an, Jordan</strong><br />Petra is believed to have been established in the 4<sup>th</sup> century B.C. as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom, an entity that grew fabulously wealthy as the nexus of trade routes in the southern Levant. The kingdom retained its independence until the Roman Empire annexed it in A.D. 106. The city is famous for its stunning rock-cut architecture and its water conduit system, which allowed the Nabataeans to control and store the water supply in this desert region and create an artificial oasis.

              "value": "<p>A private initiative to come up with a new list for seven of the world&rsquo;s wonders sprang up early in the new Millennium. Worldwide balloting &ndash; via internet or telephone &ndash; took place, covering a list of 200 existing monuments. Over 100 million votes were reportedly cast over a period of several years and the final list was announced on 7-7-2007. Even though the polling was unscientific, the seven &ldquo;winners&rdquo; were a worthy compilation of extraordinary Wonders to be found around the world. All seven of the New Wonders are inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are frequently cited in the literature.&nbsp;</p> <p>1. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/cfe9b75b793f55ead0fefc067408d760/985f3/Mexico_Chichen-Itza-Castillo-Seen-From-East.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chichen Itza</a>, Yucatan, Mexico</strong><br />This archeological site includes the impressive remains of a large pre-Columbian Mayan city that flourished from ca. A.D. 600-1100. Among the outstanding structures at the site are the massive Temple of the Warriors complex, an Observatory (El Caracol), the Great Ball Court, and the Sacred Cenote (sinkhole) where offerings were made. The most famous building, however, is the step-pyramid known as the Temple of Kukulcan that dominates the center of the site and serves as the symbol of Chichen Itza. The pyramidal structure is 24 m high; the crowning temple adds another 6 m. Although located in the dense jungles of Yucatan, it remains one of the most visited tourist sites in Mexico.</p> <p>2. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/9752cbc50baac20632cd5dceeb55a976/73435/IT_035_large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Colosseum</a>, Rome, Italy</strong><br />The Roman Emperor Vespasian began construction on the Colosseum in A.D. 72, and his son Titus completed it in A.D. 80. Further modifications were made by Domitian (A.D. 81-96). The three emperors make up the Flavian Dynasty, thus providing the structure's alternate name, the Flavian Amphitheater. The massive structure is estimated to have seated, on average, about 65 thousand spectators and was most famously used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. Earthquakes and thieves destroyed much of the original structure, but it nonetheless remains an iconic symbol of Rome. The Colosseum is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the World.</p> <p>3. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/b540f32cd327f1d5d710e9c18c10e59b/7401b/BR_001_large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christ the Redeemer Statue</a>, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</strong><br />Built between 1922 and 1931, the 30-meter-tall sculpture is reputed to be the largest Art Deco statue in the World. Its pedestal provides another 8 m in height and the arms stretch out to 28 m. Constructed of reinforced concrete and soapstone, the statue has become the cultural icon not only of Rio, but also of Brazil.</p> <p>4. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/d5c0c6d7b9939b1eac193cc810f65b1b/dcad3/CH_006_large.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Great Wall</a>, China</strong><br />The name refers to a remarkable series of fortification systems that stretched across China's northern historical borders and served as protection against various nomadic peoples. An archeological survey revealed that the Wall and all its associated branches measures 21,196 km. The earliest of these walls date to the 7<sup>th</sup> century B.C.; certain stretches began to be linked in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C., and successive dynasties added to or maintained various sections of the walls. The best-known and best-preserved portions of the wall are those built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Winding through amazingly varied terrain, the Great Wall is acknowledged as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p> <p>5. <strong><a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/05bf16fac97280b87f87cfbe3d4b2c36/f0023/2022_06_Machu_Picchu__2_.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Machu Picchu</a>, Cuzco Region, Peru</strong><br />Perhaps the most spectacular archeological site in the Americas, the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, situated on a 2,430 m Andean mountain ridge, is now thought to have been erected as an estate for the Inca Emperor Pachacuti (r. 1438-1471) and may have also served as a religious sanctuary. Built between about 1450 and 1460, it was abandoned approximately a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. Construction was carried out in the classic Inca style of polished, fitted, dry-stone walls. Some 750 people lived at this royal estate, most of them support staff to the nobility. The site is roughly divided into an agricultural sector (with myriad terraces for raising crops) and an urban sector. The latter is composed of an upper town (with temples) and a lower town (with warehouses).

          "content": "<strong>Types of Biomes: </strong><p>A biome is a biogeographical designation describing a biological community of plants and animals that has formed in response to a physical environment and a shared regional climate. Biomes can extend over more than one continent. Different classification systems define different numbers of biomes. <em>The World Factbook</em> recognizes the following seven biomes used by NASA: tundra, coniferous forest, temperate deciduous forest, rainforest, grassland, shrubland, and desert.</p><br><br><strong>Tundra biome: </strong>The tundra is the coldest of the biomes. It also receives low amounts of precipitation, making the tundra similar to a desert. Tundra comes from the Finnish word <em>tunturia</em>, meaning \"treeless plain.\" Tundra is found in the regions just below the ice caps of the Arctic, extending across North America to Europe and to Siberia in Asia. Temperatures usually range between -40&deg;C (-40 &deg;F) and 18&deg;C (64&deg;F). The temperatures are so cold that there is a layer of permanently frozen ground below the surface, called permafrost. This permafrost is a defining characteristic of the tundra biome. In the tundra summers, the top layer of soil thaws only a few inches down, providing a growing surface for the roots of vegetation. This biome sees 150 to 250 mm (6 to 10 in) of rain per year. Vegetation in the tundra has adapted to the cold and the short growing season and consists of lichens, mosses, grasses, sedges, and shrubs, but almost no trees.<br><br><strong>Coniferous Forest biome: </strong>The coniferous forest is sandwiched between the tundra to the north and the deciduous forest to the south. Coniferous forest regions have long, cold, snowy winters; warm, humid summers; well-defined seasons; and at least four to six frost-free months. The average temperature in winter ranges from -40&deg;C (-40&deg;F) to 20&deg;C (68&deg;F). The average summer temperatures are usually around 10&deg;C (50&deg;F). 300 to 900 mm (12 to 35 in) of rain per year can be expected in this biome. Vegetation consists of trees that produce cones and needles, which are called coniferous-evergreen trees. Some needles remain on the trees all year long. Some of the more common conifers are spruces, pines, and firs.<br><br><strong>Temperate Deciduous Forest biome: </strong>Temperate deciduous forests are located in the mid-latitude areas, which means that they are found between the polar regions and the tropics. The deciduous forest regions are exposed to warm and cold air masses, which cause this area to have four seasons. Hot summers and cold winters are typical. The average daily temperatures range between -30&deg;C (-22&deg;F) and 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), with a yearly average of 10&deg;C (50&deg;F). On average, this biome receives 750 to 1,500 mm (30 to 59 in) of rain per year. Vegetation includes broadleaf trees (oaks, maples, beeches), shrubs, perennial herbs, and mosses.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Rainforest biome: </strong>The rainforest biome remains warm all year and stay frost-free. The average daily temperatures range from 20&deg;C (68&deg;F) to 25&deg;C (77&deg;F). Rainforests receive the most yearly rainfall of all of the biomes, and a typical year sees 2,000 to 10,000 mm (79 to 394 in) of rain. Vegetation typically includes vines, palm trees, orchids, and ferns. There are two types of rainforests: tropical rainforests are found closer to the equator, and temperate rainforests are found farther north near coastal areas. The majority of common houseplants come from the rainforest.<br><br><strong>Grassland biome: </strong>Grasslands are open, continuous, and fairly flat areas of grass. Found on every continent except Antarctica, they are often located between temperate forests at high latitudes and deserts at subtropical latitudes.&nbsp; Depending on latitude, the annual temperature range can be -20&deg;C (-4&deg;F) to 30&deg;C (86&deg;F). Grasslands receive around 500 to 900 mm (20 to 35 in) of rain per year. Tropical grasslands have dry and wet seasons that remain warm all the time. Temperate grasslands have cold winters and warm summers with some rain. Vegetation is dominated by grasses but can include sedges and rushes, along with some legumes (clover) and herbs. A few trees may be found in this biome along the streams, but not many due to the lack of rainfall.<br><br><strong>Shrubland biome: </strong>Shrublands include chaparral, woodland, and savanna, and are composed of shrubs or short trees. Many shrubs thrive on steep, rocky slopes, but there is usually not enough rain to support tall trees. Shrublands are located in west coastal regions between 30&deg; and 40&deg; North and South latitude and are usually found on the borders of deserts and grasslands. The summers are hot and dry with temperatures up to 38&deg;C (100&deg;F). Winters are cool and moist, with temperatures around -1 &deg;C (30&deg;F). Annual rainfall in the shrublands varies greatly, but 200 to 1,000 mm (8 to 40 in) of rain per year can be expected. Vegetation includes aromatic herbs (sage, rosemary, thyme, oregano), shrubs, acacia, chamise, grasses. Plants have adapted to fire caused by frequent lightning strikes in the summer.<br><br><strong>Desert biome: </strong>The most important characteristic of a desert biome is that it receives very little rainfall, usually about 250 mm (10 in) of rain per year. During the day, desert temperatures rise to an average of 38&deg;C (100&deg;F). At night, desert temperatures fall to an average of -4&deg;C (about 25&deg;F). Vegetation is sparse, consisting of cacti, small bushes, and short grasses. Perennials survive for several years by becoming dormant and flourishing when water is available. Annuals are referred to as ephemerals because some can complete an entire life cycle in weeks. Since desert conditions are so severe, the plants that live there need to adapt to compensate. Some, such as cacti, store water in their stems and use it very slowly, while others, like bushes, conserve water by growing few leaves or by having large root systems to gather water.",
