      "caption": "Marine iguanas are unique to Ecuador’s Galapagos archipelago, with the largest colonies in Punta Espinosa on Fernandina Island. They are the only lizards in the world that spend time in the ocean and can dive more than 20 m (65 feet) underwater. Unlike terrestrial lizards, marine iguanas have short, blunt snouts and small, razor-sharp teeth that help them scrape the algae off rocks and flattened tails that help them swim. Because they feed underwater, marine iguanas have glands that remove excess salt from the ingested ocean water to prevent dehydration. During times of food scarcity, the marine iguana can shrink as much 20%, requiring less food and regaining their size when algae restock.",
